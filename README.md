#### Transformer Models from Scratch
 
I've been inspired to dig in to sequential models after finishing Standford's CS-224n course on NLP and deep learning. I have a few project in mind to apply these things, but I want to understand them a bit better before I do. 

In this repo I'Il be cobbling together some pieces of transformers from the classic paper, Attention is All You Need. 
 

For this I'll be taking inspiration from a few well written blog posts and super helpful courses by Peter Bloem @  VU University of Amsterdam. If you're out there, thanks for making some of these concepts start to click in a concrete way.
